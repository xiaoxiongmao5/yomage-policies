    <h1 style="text-align: center;">Terms of Use</h1>

    <p>Welcome to “Hamster Keeper” (the “App”). Please read and agree before using. The App offers photo recognition entry, expiry reminder, draft handoff, cloud sync, and membership services.</p>
    <h2>1. Account and Sign-in</h2>
    <p>You may sign in with Apple. After sign-in, the system recognizes your identity via token to enable cloud sync and membership benefits.</p>
    <h2>2. Service Content and Changes</h2>
    <p>We iterate features continuously and may adjust or suspend some services for operational or compliance reasons.</p>
    <h2>3. AI-assisted Recognition and Food Safety Disclaimer</h2>
    <p>Features such as photo recognition, expiry estimation, and ingredient/product attribute inference are powered by algorithms or models and are for reference only. Results may be inaccurate or incomplete due to photo quality, packaging variations, language/locale differences, missing or abnormal barcodes/labels, and other factors.</p>
    <p>For your food safety and health:</p>
    <p>1) Before saving to the official item list, always verify key information yourself, including name, specification, production/opening date, shelf life, expiry time, and storage method.</p>
    <p>2) For high-risk products (e.g., cold-chain/refrigerated items, perishable foods, infant foods, and medicinal/edible items), rely on actual package labeling and instructions from the merchant/producer.</p>
    <p>3) The App does not provide medical or food safety advice. If health risks or allergies are involved, consult professionals.</p>
    <p>4) To the extent permitted by law, the App is not liable for losses or risks caused by failure to verify or by reliance on recognition results (including but not limited to food spoilage, consumption past expiry, allergic reactions, etc.).</p>
    <h2>4. User Conduct</h2>
    <p>Do not upload illegal, infringing, obscene, or harmful content; do not attack, reverse engineer, crawl, or abuse APIs; do not use the App for any unlawful or unethical purposes.</p>
    <h2>5. Fees and Membership</h2>
    <p>Some features are paid or membership services. Prices and benefits are as published in the App. You agree to follow IAP-related rules.</p>
    <h2>6. Data and Privacy</h2>
    <p>We process your personal information per the Privacy Policy, including login identifiers, device info, logs, orders and payments, etc.</p>
    <p><strong>Drafts stored locally only:</strong> Content in the Drafts box is stored on your device and is not uploaded to the cloud automatically. Only after you confirm and save as “official items” will records be synced to the cloud for cross‑device consistency and reminder services.</p>
    <p><strong>Images stored locally only:</strong> All images, including those for drafts and official items, are stored only on your device. We do not store these images on our servers. If you uninstall the app, these local images will be irrecoverably lost, regardless of your sign‑in status.</p>
    <h2>7. Account Deletion and Data Removal</h2>
    <p>You can initiate “Delete Account” in-app at Settings → Account & Privacy. After verification, we will delete deletable personal information and cloud data associated with your account. Note: Deleting your account does not cancel active subscriptions. To cancel, go to iOS Settings → Apple ID → Subscriptions.</p>
    <h2>8. Content and IP</h2>
    <p>The App UI, copy, algorithms and technology are protected by copyright and related laws. Do not reproduce, distribute or use commercially without permission.</p>
    <h2>9. Protection of Minors</h2>
    <p>Minors should use the App with guardian guidance and reasonably control usage time.</p>
    <h2>10. Liability Limitation</h2>
    <p>To the extent permitted by law, we are not liable for indirect losses caused by force majeure, network failure, or third parties.</p>
    <h2>11. Dispute Resolution and Applicable Law</h2>
    <p>Disputes shall be resolved through friendly negotiation first; failing which, by the court where the App operator is located.</p>

    <h2>12. Relationship with Apple</h2>
