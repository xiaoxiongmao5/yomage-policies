    <h1 style="text-align: center;">Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p style="text-align: center; color: #6e6e73; font-size: 0.9em; margin-bottom: 40px; font-style: italic;">Effective: Jun 15, 2025</p>

    <p>This policy applies to your use of “Hamster Keeper”. We process your personal information under the principles of data minimization, purpose limitation, and security control.</p>
    <h2>1. Information We Process</h2>
    <p>Account/login identifiers (Apple ID Token), device and system info, operation logs, order and payment info, push identifier (JPush alias), etc. Recognition/captured content is used only for core features and is not repurposed for identity-related use.</p>
    <h2>2. Purpose of Processing</h2>
    <p>Identity/authentication and session maintenance, cloud sync, reminder services, payment fulfillment, analytics and risk control, and compliance retention required by law.</p>
    <p><strong>Drafts stored locally only:</strong> Content in the Drafts box is stored on your device and is not uploaded to the cloud automatically. Only after you confirm and save as “official items” will records be synced to the cloud for cross‑device consistency and reminder services.</p>
    <p><strong>Images stored locally only:</strong> All images, including those for drafts and official items, are stored only on your device. We do not store these images on our servers. If you uninstall the app, these local images will be irrecoverably lost, regardless of your sign‑in status.</p>
    <h2>3. Sharing and Delegated Processing</h2>
    <p>We share data only when necessary with service providers such as Apple (payment) and JPush (push), under data protection agreements. We do not sell personal information.</p>
    <h2>4. Retention and Jurisdiction</h2>
    <p>Personal information is retained for the minimum period necessary to achieve the purposes; longer retention where legally required. Data may be stored on domestic servers; cross-border transfer will meet legal requirements.</p>
    <h2>5. Your Rights</h2>
    <p>You may exercise access, correction, deletion, revocation of consent, or account closure via “Settings → Privacy” or email at <a href="mailto:xiaoxiong@yomage.com">xiaoxiong@yomage.com</a>.</p>
    <h2>6. Account Deletion and Data Handling</h2>
    <p>You can initiate “Delete Account” in-app at Settings → Account & Privacy. After verification, we will delete deletable personal information and cloud data associated with your account. This action is irreversible. Note: Account deletion does not cancel active subscriptions. To cancel, go to iOS Settings → Apple ID → Subscriptions.</p>
    <h2>7. Protection of Minors</h2>
    <p>Minors should use the app with guardian consent and guidance. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under 14.</p>
    <h2>8. Updates to This Policy</h2>
    <p>We will announce updates in-app. For material changes, we will notify you prominently and seek consent where required.</p>
    <h2>9. Contact and Complaints</h2>
    <p>If you have questions about this policy or personal data protection, contact us at <a href="mailto:xiaoxiong@yomage.com">xiaoxiong@yomage.com</a>.</p>
